"""
In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the closest to zero.

Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data.
If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero
(for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).

Game Input
Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the result on the standard output.

# Input
Line 1: N, the number of temperatures to analyze

Line 2: A string with the N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526

# Output
Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.
Constraints
0 â‰¤ N < 10000

Example
Input               |  Output
5                   |       1
1 -2 -8 4 5         |
